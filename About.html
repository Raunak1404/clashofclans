                Hey there, fellow clashers! I'm a budding clasher who's been addicted to Clash of Clans since 2014. Yup, I've been smashing walls and raiding bases for nearly a decade! My journey in this epic game has taken me to some awesome heights. I became a professional base builder and had the incredible opportunity to work with NAVI, one of the most legendary clashing teams out there. Crafting rock-solid bases for such a renowned team was a dream come true and honed my skills to perfection.

                But that's not all! I also crafted some killer bases for TWOB, the fan-favorite Indian clashing team, during the Queso Cup. Shoutout to Sumit007—those defenses were lit and held strong against many pro teams! Seeing my bases withstand top-tier attacks was absolutely epic. When it comes to attacking, I'm no slouch either. I've got mad skills in Queen Charge Lalo, Queen Charge Hybrid, Zap Lalo, Blizz Lalo, and a variety of Smash Attacks. If it's about tearing through bases, I've got it covered with finesse and strategy.

                Right now, I'm a university student juggling books and battles. But hey, I'm on the lookout for a pro team to dive back into the competitive clash scene. Ready to bring the heat and make a comeback! Let's clash on!
